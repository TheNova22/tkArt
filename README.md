# tkArt
**tkArt is a project created to explore art creation with Python using algorithms and geometry.**

The project works using [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), the standard GUI library for Python.

## Usage
Width and Height for the canvas is mentioned at the start of each file, you can edit and set it to your preference.
```python
# Example values
width = 500
height = 500
```

Each file has comments that explains the code written below it.

To the run the file, use
``` python3 <fileName>.py ```

## Learning
This repository contains a [LEARN.md](https://github.com/TheNova22/tkArt/blob/main/LEARN.md) which users can learn and understand how the project works.

Through this, users can even potentially move on to contributing and improving tkArt.
